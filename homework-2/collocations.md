1. I used to be medium but I need a large size because I've put on weight.
2. Fortunately the shop I go to has a vast range of shirts and jumpers to choose from.
3. I've also got very broad shoulders, but my waist is quite small.
4. A few men can't find clothes to fit them, but the wide majority are small, medium or large.
