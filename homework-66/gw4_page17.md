    - What were you doing at ten o'clock this morning?
    - I was reading some important documents in my office.

    - Why are you so disappointed?

    - Have you found your bag yet?
    - No, but I reported it stolen to the police yesterday.

    - Did you enjoy the play last night?
    - No, even though I read good reviews of it before I bought the tickets.

    - Have you written your report yet?
    - I've just started when you came in actually.

    - Sorry, I'm late.
    - Where have you been? I expected you an hour ago.

    - We went to an antique market yesterday.
    - Did you buy anything?

    - Were you surprised that the factory closed down?
    - Not really. In fact, I had known it was going to happen.

    - Julia did well in the test, didn't she?
    - Yes. She had studied very hard for it.
