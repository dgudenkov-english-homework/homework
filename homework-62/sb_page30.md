        1. One of my favorite action films of all time is The Terminator.
        2. Jamie Foxx stars in Ray, a great biopic of Ray Charles.
        3. Pretty Woman, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, is my favourite romantic comedy.
        4. I'm not a great fan period drama, but I thought this production of Jane Eyre was brilliant.
        5. I loved the psychological-thriller, Silence of the Lambs, but I found it very scary.
        6. I still enjoy Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. It's one of the best ever detective films.
        7. I can't watch science fiction films, like Star Wars and Alien. I can't stand them.
        8. I think documentary films, like Nixon, are a great way to learn about what really happened during important events.
