    Hello everybody! My name is Shane Towers. I was a teacher, but at the moment I took a year off to finish my Master's Degree. I didn't start working with children until 2005, but now I love it. 
    Today I'm going to talk about Theatre of the Oppressed. I first saw the name when I was looking through some articles for my degree. I was reading the article about drama in education and suddenly the name jumped out at me: "Theatre of the Oppressed".
