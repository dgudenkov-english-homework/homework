What if vaccination wouldn't have existed?

Have you thought about the world without vaccines?  I think it would have been an awful world if Edward Jenner hadn't invented his vaccine.

I guess that we could have fewer people in the world now because a lot of them would have died from some diseases like pox. Maybe a "plague doctor" suit would have been our regular suit. Probably we could have worn something like a "spacesuit" to protect ourselves from other people. Also if some governments had isolated people, we would have stayed at home forever. As result, we would have lost a lot of things that we have in modern life because so many inventions were made in people's cooperation.

However, people are easily adaptable to any conditions and their life would have been very different from ours and it will be uncomfortable for us, but not for them. And we could feel their life in 2020, during the global lockdown, and I'm sure we don't want isolation again. And I hope we will never know life without any vaccines.
