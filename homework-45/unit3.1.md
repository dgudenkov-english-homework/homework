    A search for the missing child is East Paterson ended happily last week after five-year-old Ricky Ross was found asleep in his own room.
    Last Monday, Julie Ross, the boy's mother was working in the front garden when she heard her son cry out. He was playing in living room, but when she
    ran to the house, she saw that the back door was open and there was no sign of her son.
    Neighbours joined in the search and when they found a few pieces of children's clothing. There was initial panic but it was soon clear that
    the clothing was there for years and didn't belong to the boy. Ricky was eventually found by another child who had gone into the boy's room
    while the search was going on because she heard a noise from the toy box. When she opened it, there was Ricky safe and sound - he was sleeping in the toy box
    the whole time, unaware of the panic he had caused.
