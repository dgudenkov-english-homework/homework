    What's your favorite gadget in the kitchen?

    My favorite gadget in the kitchen is the dishwasher. It's much faster than me at washing up. The problem is that I'm getting a little bit lazier.

    The toaster. Morning is by far the best time of the day for me. I enjoy a relaxing breakfast. And toast is a lot tastier than bread. I love it.

    I don't cook very much, because I'm too busy. I have a microwave, which I find makes it a bit easier. Now, I eat slightly better than I did before.
