    The pneumatic tire: how did it start?

    John Dunlop, a Scottish vet, was responsible for one of the world's great inventions.
    Dunlop's young son kept falling off his tricycle because the bumpy streets were hopeless for cycling. Dunlop thought of a creative solution: filling the rubber tires with air. This, he realised, would be an easier way to make the tricycle more stable. He was right: it turned out to be a very effective solution. Lots of cyclists copied the idea and the air tire became very successful. French car makers realised it was a valuable idea and the air tire became very profitable; Dunlop Tyres is still a huge company today.
