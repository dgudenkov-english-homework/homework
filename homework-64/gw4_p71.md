3.
    1. I ran all the way to work, but I needn't have hurried because I was the first person to arrive.
    2. We didn't need to hurry, so we stopped to have lunch on the way.
    3. I went to college today, but I needn't have gone as all the lectures were canceled.
    4. I didn't need to ask the way to Lewes since I'd been there before.
    5. I didn't need to buy any food, so I didn't go to the supermarket.
    6. I needn't have bought any food after all, because we had plenty at home.
    7. I didn't have to pack my shorts, as it rained all week.
    8. We didn't have packed many things, as we would only be away for one night.
