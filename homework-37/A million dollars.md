I don't know. How I got ten million dollars? If I earned it, then I know what to do with it. I think that I earned it on the exchange or some business.
And I'm going to invest them in the exchange or business. If I won it, then I'm going to pay off my mortgage and go to Europe that practice English and maybe find some work to relocate. And maybe I will buy a flat in the country that I like. It's a difficult question - I didn't think about it before.
