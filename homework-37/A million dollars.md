I don't know. How did I get a million dollars? If I earned them, then I know what to do with them.
I think it's connected with the invest or some business.
And I'm going to invest them in the business. If I won it, then I'm going to pay off my mortgage and go to Europe to practice English and maybe find some work to relocate.
And maybe I will buy a flat in the country that I like. It's a difficult question - I didn't think about it before.
