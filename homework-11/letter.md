Hi John! This is Dmitry. I want to invite you to see my hometown. It's a historical town.

I don't know the old town history, but I know the new history. In this town lived and worked Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovskiy and wrote about cosmonautic, so the town is called "Cosmonautics cradle". In 1961 here was build the first museum of cosmonautic history in the world. Now, around the museum are located three rockets in natural size. Also, there are exists a planetarium. And this museum is located on Oka river bank. 

Also, there are many old buildings which are architectural monuments. For example - Gostiny Dvor, Kamenniy most and Kamennye palati Korobova.

So come. Best regards - Dmitry.
