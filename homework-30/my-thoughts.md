My thoughts

I liked our lesson in real life because it was more productivity and I wrote some notes on the PAPER.
But I didn't like the place, because it was quite noisy.
I didn't know what to show you in Moscow.
I thought, that the ArtPlay is an uncommon place for the first-time tourist in Moscow.
But I couldn't recognize your thoughts about this place.
And I hadn't known the fast path to that place.
I don't understand a stand-up.
I watched it before and I liked it, but some time ago I stopped like it.
I don't like Arbat street.
It is a very hype place and I don't like the people who are there and I don't like the street view.
Taisia was a very strange person.
She was like an alien, but she was funny.
And you were serious, like her mother or some kind of.
But I think that she did it not to irritate you, she just wanted some attention to herself.
Or maybe not, I don't know.
I can so much talk about it, but I will be an armchair psychologist.
I'm hard to meet new people.
Even though I know them remote.
I need some time to feel confident and stop to try to be serious and start to make some unexpected things, like a duck-quack or frog-quack.
I was happy because I left home that weekend, but I was unhappy because of my tooth sick.
