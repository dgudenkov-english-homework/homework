  7. When I meet people on holiday I always promise to keep in touch, but I never do.
  8. I didn't really enjoy the holiday because I caught a cold on the second day and spent most of the week sneezing and blowing my nose.
  9. When you organise a conference or a course, I think you need something to break the ice, otherwise people are a bit nervous of each other.
  10. I don't see the point of spending a lot of money on children's clothes because they only last for a few months and they're too small.
