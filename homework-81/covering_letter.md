Dear Zara McBrien

I am writing to you about the Frontend Engineer position - zDirect at Zalando, which I saw on https://jobs.zalando.com/en/jobs/1880830-frontend-engineer-zdirect-marketplace-platform. I would like to apply for this position. Please find my CV attached. 

I spent the last five years working as a frontend engineer in different companies and I believe that I meet all requirements you outline in your advertisement. I have experience in e-commerce - I worked for Ru-Center - it is a domain seller and I led a group of developers. We developed a domain shop with a huge wizard where you can buy a domain and additional products. Currently, I am working as a frontend developer for Yandex.Market - it is a large service where you can choose products and buy them in a different online shop.

I have strong knowledge of React and related libraries: Redux, Redus-Saga, Redux-observable, Mobx. I maintained webpack for all projects in Ru-Center. Also, I can not imagine my code without typings - I am using Typescript for my code and have two years of experience with Flow. I care about code quality and writing tests using jest and selenium where it is necessary. I prefer the functional paradigm in my code, and I implemented few functions in Ramda adjunct library during "Hacktoberfest". Usually, I am cooperating with designers and product owners to make a product better. When I was a team leader I owned the whole development cycle: from architecture design to implementation, testing, and maintenance of our products.

Thank you for your consideration. If you require any further information or would like to arrange an interview, please call me on 8-800-555-35-35 or email me at dimangud1994@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely,

Dmitriy Gudenkov
