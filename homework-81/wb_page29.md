    I used to work for a big company. I used to work long hours and I would dream of living in a more exotic location, sitting on a beach with my laptop. Now I run my own website business. I don't earn as much money as I used to earn, but I'm much happier.

    I used to work as a computer programmer. Most of the time, I used to enjoy it. But I didn't used to like being in an office all day. So, I decided to get a job working outdoors. Now, I train people in forestry skills, so I'm outside most of the time. And my lifestyle is much healthier than it used to be.

        - I used to seat in my grandfather's studio and watched him paint.
        - Children used to play around the streets it the old days, but there's nobody here now.
        - They used to live in the big house, but they had to move.

        Dear Ms. Nelson.

        I am writing to you about the summer position at SunnySam's Electronics, advertised on www.summerjobstudents.com. I want to apply for the post. I attach my CV, application form, and all the information required in the advertisement.

        I am currently studying English at Exter University and I am looking for summer work to help me finance my studies. I think I would be good at this job. Firstly, I am both hard-working and organised, and I have excellent communication skills. Secondary, I have shown that I am good at customer service. In my previous job, on the reception desk at Queen's Hospital, I had practical experience of proving quality customer service and working with all types of people.

        I believe that my communication skills, customer service abilities, and positive work ethic would make me an asset to the shop.

        Thank you for your consideration. If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached at vinniej22@dmail.com or 07788 922 123. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
