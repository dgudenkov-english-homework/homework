In my opinion, the first thing to help people grow their weekly physical activity is telling people how important it is. For example, most adult people in Russia don't know about this recommendation, and because of that don't follow it. That's why I think the doctors or government or even people need to tell others about physical activity. Maybe it will be something like positive propaganda.
The second thing that we need is something to help people control their activity like fitness bracelets. With this thing, people will be able to control their phisycal shape.
And the third thing is competition with their friends! Or something like a game for people without friends. It can be an application for fitness bracelets or something like this. As I know Apple watch has this feature. It has circles that you should fill with your activity. And I know people who looked at the watch when they were coming home and saw there an almost filled circle. And they decided to walk one circle around their block of flats to fill it!
And let's recap it! To help people with physical activities we need three things: information, technology, and social engagement. And no thing will work without others.
