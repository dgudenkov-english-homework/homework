    - The most important thing is to remember not to go out alone
    - If I were you, I would bring waterproof clothes
    - Make sure you wear a helmet and protective clothing when you ride a bike 
    - Be careful when you're on the main roads. They're always very busy
    - Don't forget to keep your luggage with you at all times
    - Whatever you do, don't buy food from the street sellers. It's terrible
    - Watch out for people trying to sell you fake watches
    - You'd better leave your valuables in the hotel
