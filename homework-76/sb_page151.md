4.1
    1. I work as a personal assistant for a large corporation. I usually work nine-to-five, but sometimes I have to work late. My job involves checking and responding to emails, answering phone enquiries, and organising my boss's diary.

    2. I'm an accountant. I tend to work long hours. I'm responsible for a small team of people. I spend a lot of my time attending meetings and dealing with problems. I advise clients on their accounts and write updates and reports for the website.

    3. I'm a window cleaner. Lots of people wouldn't like what I do, because it's an outdoor job, and it's a physical job, but I love it. I work for myself, so I can be very independent, and I work flexible hours, which is good for me. It's a very sociable job, too. I talk to people all day long. I couldn't do an office job. I would die of boredom!
