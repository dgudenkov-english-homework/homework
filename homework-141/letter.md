Hi Mark! As you asked I found a flat for you.

It's a beautiful single room flat outskirts, near your university. I found it at the internal network, at work. It doesn't look like "grandma" or "soviet" style, like so many flats in Moscow. The flat has a minimalist style, like flats in "Ikea" magazine. There are a washing machine, a bath, and a shower, and a small kitchen with a dishwasher. And there are some flowers, you have to look at.

I advise you to bring some warm weather because winters in Russia are cold. You need a warm jacket, few sweaters, thermal underwear, and warm boots. But don't forget summer clothes! Summer in Russia is enough warm, to wear t-shirts and shorts. 

And one more thing - don't forget your passport and always keep it with you, because if a police officer stops you without a passport it could be a problem.

Please write me before you come here, I'll meet you at the airport. I hope you enjoy Russia. Bye!
