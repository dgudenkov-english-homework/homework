    Hi Ros
    Are you doing anything at the weekend? Do you want to come out with us? Danny and I are going out on Saturday night. It would be great if you could come. We could try one of the restaurants in Trastevere - it's really nice round there. One thing we've planned is we are meeting up with a few people from the course for a drink first, in Piazza Santa Maria. Do you know it? We will be outside Cafe Marzo from about 6.30, if you want to join us. I'm not sure how late we will be. If anyone still has enough energy at the end of the evening, a DJ friend of mine is playing at the Gioia Music Restaurant, so we could go there and dance a bit afterwards. We'll see how things go. I'll call you tomorrow to see what your plans are.
    Speak soon,
    Silvia.
