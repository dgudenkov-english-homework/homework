    1. When was the last time you gave someone a hand?
    2. Which student do you think is a dark horse?
    3. When's the last time you put your foot in it?
    4. Which issues are close to your heart?
    5. Do you often have to work against the clock?
    6. When were you last in hot water?

Today I've worked against the clock because the other team fucked up. Really. We are in hot water because of them. Let's face it: we gave them a hand, but they did the experiment wrong and we should rewrite our experiment in two days. I did it, but I made some shit code. It's not my cup of tea.
