I strongly disagree with the teacher! I think public transport has a great future at least in big cities. Now, all big cities have a common problem - busy traffic. The more people we have in the city, the more traffic they produce and the development of road infrastructure doesn't help it. If each person in the city had a car, there wouldn't be any free space. The urbanists say that this problem can be solved with public transport. If the city authorities closed the city center for personal cars and improved pedestrian infrastructure, the problem with traffic would be solved. Also public transport would be a common way to reach the city center and move around there. I know that in Helsinki public transport is very good and comfortable. Trams, buses, trains, subway - so many choices, and people are happy with it. Based on this public transport has a great future and it will help to solve the traffic problem.
