I strongly disagree with the teacher! I think public transport has a great future at least in big cities. Now, all big cities have a common problem - high traffic jam. The more people in the city we have, the more traffic jam they produce and the development of road infrastructure don't help it. Let's imagine if each person in the city had had an auto, there are wouldn't be a free space. And the urbanists say that this problem can be solved with public transport. If the city authorities had closed the city center for personal autos and had made pedestrian infrastructure the problem with traffic would be solved. And public transport will be a common way to reach the city center and move around there. I know that in Helsinki public transport is very good and comfortable. Trams, buses, trains, subway - so many choices, and people happy with it. Based on this public transport has a great future and it will help to solve the traffic jam problem.
