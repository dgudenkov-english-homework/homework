    Hi Francesca,

    How are things? We've just had a great weekend. Ali and Greg are over from New Zealand, so we decided to meet up. They wanted to see London, so I suggested spending a couple of days there. Louise invited us to stay at her place, which made things easier. She also offered to take some time off work, so she could show us around the sights. She explained that it would be easier to travel around with someone who knows where everything is. We were planning to get an organised bus tour, but Louise recommended traveling by ourselves on the buses and Underground. It was a great way to see the city. There were so many things we all wanted to see, but we agreed to choose one or two things each. I was really keen to go on the London Eye, but Louise warned us not to go up because the weather was bad. We saw lots of other things though, like Big Ben and the Tate Modern. I promise to write and tell you about it. Next time, you must come, too!

    Hope you're well. Take care.
    Matt
