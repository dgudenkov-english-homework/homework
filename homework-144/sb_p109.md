    Howard Lovecraft is an American writer, who was writing horror fiction, fantasy, science fiction and combined it in an original style. He created his own branch of horror fiction - Lovecraft horrors.

    Lovecraft was born in Providence, the USA in 1980. He was a wunderkind - he recited poetry at two and wrote poetry at six. At fourteen he wrote his first story "The beast in the cave", but later he decided to write poems, and came back to horror fiction in 1917. The most active period of Lovecraft was 1919-1923 years. He wrote more than 40 horror fiction stories, but he made a living as an editor. He died in 1937 of cancer.

    Lovecraft made an impact on horror fiction. Stephen King was inspired by Lovecraft's books. Some writers continued to write "Myths of Ktulhu" and they are been called "Circle of Lovecraft". I think he rethought horror fiction.
