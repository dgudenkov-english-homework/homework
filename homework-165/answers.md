If you had asked me to describe myself in three words I would have said clever, responsible, and easy-dependent. I don't know how my friends describe me, but I suppose that they can say that I'm smart, have bad jokes, and supportive person. I haven't thought about my "perfect" flatmate before. I think he shouldn't annoy me if he/she is not my friend. I don't want a very social flatmate, because I prefer to keep myself to myself. I'm not a very clean person, but I'm quite tidy. I think if my future flatmate is very clean we won't be able to find a common language. But I think we can divide our housework or do it in a queue and it will be fine. In general, I don't like neighbors without common interests with me. I think I couldn't live with another unfamiliar person.
