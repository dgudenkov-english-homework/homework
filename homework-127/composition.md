I agree that exercise is important for our health, but I know two things that more important than exercise.

The first thing is healthy food. I know that it's important because I had some problems because of my diet. And when I changed my diet my problems have disappeared. I started to eat more vegetables and fewer sweets and it helped me. And you have to drink at least two liters of clean water every day.

The second thing is you need to control your stress level. I read popular science medicine articles where there was written that then more stress you have then more chance to have problems with your health. And I think it's true because your organism should spend more resources to handle your stress instead of its normal functionality. 

Let's recap it - if you want to be healthy you need at least three things: a healthy diet, low-stress level, and exercise.
