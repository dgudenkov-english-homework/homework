    Like most translators, I speak several languages. At the moment, I'm attending a conference. I was doing some work for an internet company when I heard about this conference. I arrived three days ago and I'm going to stay until Monday when it ends.

    My best friend is called Gina. We don't speak to each other every day, but we're very close. I met her on my first morning at university. I was looking for the library when she came up to me and asked, "Excuse me, do you know where the library is?" We found it together!
