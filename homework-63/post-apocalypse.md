If nuclear apocalypse comes, I see one way how not to die. If I am at work when I hear a sound warning about the bomb I would go to the subway, because there is a safe-nuclear-space from the Soviet Union. Then I would join other people to survive. Or not ...

If zombie apocalypse comes, I would try to go from Moscow to some village. And I would follow the rules from the "Welcome to Zombieland" movie. Or maybe I would become one of the first zombies and die.

If an unknown disease comes, I would stay at home and follow WHO recommendations. I would go out only to buy some food. Oh, wait ...

If I go to China I wouldn't eat any bats. I promise.
