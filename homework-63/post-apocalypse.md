If nuclear apocalypse becomes, I see one way how not to die. If I am on work when I hear a sound warning about a bomb I would go to the subway, because there is a safe-nuclear-space from the Soviet Union. Then I would join with other people to survive. Or not ...

If zombie apocalypse becomes, I would try to go from Moscow to some village. And I would follow the rules from the "Welcome to Zombieland" movie. Or maybe I'll became one of the first zombies and die.

If an unknown disease becomes, I would stay at home and follow WHO recommendations. I would go out only to buy some food. Oh, wait ...

If I go to China I wouldn't eat any bats. I promise.
