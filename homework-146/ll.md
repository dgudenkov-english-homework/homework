I know that there are five love languages: words of affirmation, physical touch, receiving gifts, quality time, and acts of service. Recently I have found out that my primary love language is words of affirmation. I don't know much about this language, but I think it's true. I'll ask my psychologist about this language and aks for her advice about studying it. I think love languages are very useful in relationships. If you know your love language and your partner's love language you know how to make your partner happy.
