What is the purpose of my life?

It is a hard question. I don't have an answer, but I can try to speculate about it.

I don't have the purpose of my life in general, but I have current purposes.
One of them - I want to finish the main repair in my flat. It includes a kitchen, table, sofa, and chair.
Also, I want to be a good specialist, so I try to learn something new on conferences, in the Internet and etc.
Besides, I usually choose a person, which inspires me, and I try to be like him in separate things, not in general.

I think, that the purpose prevents live now, you are thinking about the purpose, but you aren't enjoying the moment.
But each person should have a dream. A Dream is another thing than the purpose. It helps you to live and in my opinion, your dream should be real, but unreachable.

Maybe the purpose of my life - is being a good character in the story of my life.
