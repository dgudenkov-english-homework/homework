        I work as a frontend developer in Yandex.Market. I usually wake up by about 9.10 and have a shower and make breakfast. I go to work by train and underground - it takes about an hour - usually getting there at about 11.30. The first thing I do is make tea and check the email. 

        I work in a team of ten people. Last eight months we are updating the front-end stack of technologies. We have a strong deadline and don't have enough resources to do that. And other teams are doing their job on the old stack with us. It looks like we are rebuilding the car engine on the go. We have a daily meeting at 12 o'clock.

        I have a break for lunch at about 13 o'clock. I go with my friends to the cafe. Then I work until 20.00 and then go home. I get home at about 21.15 and cook supper and play computer games.
