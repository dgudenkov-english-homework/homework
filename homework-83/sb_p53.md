        I work as a frontend developer in Yandex.Market. I usually wake up at about 9.10 and have a shower and make breakfast. I go to work by train and underground - it takes about an hour - usually get there at about 11.30. The first thing I do is making tea and checking my emails.

        I work in a team of ten people. We have been updating the front-end stack of technologies for the last eight months. We have a strong deadline and don't have enough resources to do that. And other teams are doing their job on the old stack at the same time. It looks like we are rebuilding the car engine on the go. We have a daily meeting at 12 o'clock.

        I have a break for lunch at about 1 p.m. I go with my friends to the cafe. Then I work until 8 p.m. and then go home. I get home at about 9.15 p.m. and cook supper and play computer games.
