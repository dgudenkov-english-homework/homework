    One of the strongest memories of my childhood - it's how I tried to hide from my grandfather to skip the tennis. I didn't want to go to the tennis seven days a week and tried to skip it. It all started one day when I was on the dacha with my grandmother and my grandfather came there. I was hiding behind the stove, while my grandfather tried to find me. When he climbed to the second floor - I came out of the stove and went to the garden. Then he went to the garden too and I was going behind the house to the fence and then climbed over the fence and run to the forest. He didn't find me that day.
