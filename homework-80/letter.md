Why do I like Lord of the rings?

Hi Alina, recently I reviewed three parts of Lord of the rings and you asked why do I like it. I like it because it's an epic fantasy adventure movie. It has an interesting story with different lines contains a love story, action, and drama. And the graphics effects are cool for the 2000s. I like the epic battles in the movie. My lovely battle scene - a battle for Minas Tirith. I would like giant elephants when I was a child. I hope I answered your question.

Talk soon. Dmitry.
