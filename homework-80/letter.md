Why do I like Lord of the rings?

Hi Alina,

I have recently re-watched three parts of Lord of the rings and you asked why I like this trilogy. I like it because it's an epic fantasy adventure movies. It has an interesting story with different lines that contain a love story, action, and drama. And the graphic effects are cool for the 2000s. I like the epic battles in the trilogy. My favorite battle scene - a battle for Minas Tirith. I used to like giant elephants when I was a child. I hope I answered your question.

Talk soon.
Dmitry
