    a. It's every young girl's dream to be an actress when she grew up. I would love watching beautiful actresses on television. I was so sure that I wanted to do that I would practice my Oscar speech in front of the mirror in the bathroom. I would use my shampoo bottle, and I thanked all my family and friends, even my three cats, for helping me!

    My family used to live in Sheffield, just near the football stadium, so as a child, I would go to football matches most weekends. I remember the first match I went to, my granddad took me. I was very young, and I had never seen so many people in one place at one time. It was quite frightening, and I don't think I watched the game very much. But I remember that we won, and the crowd went crazy. After that, every week I would ask Granddad if he had tickets, and usually, he did.
