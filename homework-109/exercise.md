One theory by writer Malcolm Gladwell is that if you focus on a skill when you're young and spend 10000 hours practicing it before the age of twenty, you can master it. So any teenager who has the opportunity to learn a skill should give it a try. It will help them believe in themselves and they may even become world-class at something
