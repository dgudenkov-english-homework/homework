  - Hello Mark. You took a long time to answer the door.
  - Sorry. I didn't hear the bell. Come in, Tony.
  - What do you plan today?
  - Well, I think of going for a picnic in the country, but the weather is awful so I'll change my mind.
  - Oh dear. Well, yesterday Mary told me that she had bought two tickets to see the Rocking Stars, but she couldn't go to the concert. So I'm going to buy the tickets from her because I think you'd like to go.
  - Tony, that's brilliant! I meant to buy tickets for that concert, but they had sold out by the time I went to the booking office.
  - Well, it's lucky I'll see Mary then isn't it?

  4. Paula is drinking tea as she is waiting for Charles. She wonders if he is late as usual. She will wait until the clock strikes five and then she will call him in case he will forget.
