  - Hello Mark. You took a long time to answer the door.
  - Sorry. I didn't hear the bell. Come in, Tony.
  - What are you planning today?
  - Well, I thought of going for a picnic in the country, but the weather is awful so I've changed my mind.
  - Oh dear. Well, yesterday Mary told me that she had bought two tickets to see the Rocking Stars, but she couldn't go to the concert. So I bought the tickets from her because I thought you'd like to go.
  - Tony, that's brilliant! I meant to buy tickets for that concert, but they had sold out by the time I went to the booking office.
  - Well, it's lucky I saw Mary then isn't it?
