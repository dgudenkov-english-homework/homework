    My website of the month is Yandex Market. It's a website where you can choose a product.

    I like it because of its features. You can read reviews on the products, compare offers and find the best shop where you can buy your product. Also, you can select several products and compare its specification, and if you don't know what the characteristic of you can read their description. I visit it every day because I develop it. But it's so useful before the holidays when you choose presents for your family and friends.

    It has a community of users who writes reviews on products. I recommend trying it for each person who wants to buy something.
