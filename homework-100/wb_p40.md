    Dear Stephan.

    If I were you, I would ask your friend to let you come with your girlfriend to his marriage. I think the marriage won't be the whole week. You can try to change the start/finish of your holiday a day later/earlier. If you can't change the holiday dates you probably can talk with your friend about it and explain to him the situation. I think both of us very smart and you can find a solution together.
