    If once I create my own video channel I'll name it "From zero to I don't know". I'm going to make education videos for people who are starting to learn something new and have the same questions as me. I'm going to start doing a thing that I learn and ask myself some questions and try to answer them by google. My rivals will be many educations channels that explain how to do something, but they couldn't answer the questions for newbies because they know so much. I'll upload new videos when I'm ready.

    a. I don't know, it depends on investors. I think these videos could find their own auditory, but they won't be so popular, because people like to watch some trash or relaxing videos and don't want to think during the watching. 

    b.
        - We are looking for inspiration
        - We intend to make some education videos for fun
        - The videos will be presented by me
        - Our target audience are some bored people who want to learn something new
        - We thank for the watching, subscribe to my channel, maybe I'll upload a new video
