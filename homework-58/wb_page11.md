    - What happened to you on Saturday night? We were waiting for ages but you didn't come.
    - I'm really sorry. I was driving back from Aga's house when my car broke down.
    - Why didn't you call?
    - My phone ran out of battery.

     - Did you enjoy your dinner last night?
     - No. Actually, I hated it.
     - Why? What happened?
     - Well, we booked a table, but I didn' realised it was right by the door. People were coming in and out all evening and it was freezing. Then, when the waiter was pouring my wine, he spilled it down my dress. And also, we ordered fish, which they had said was fresh. But when it arrived it tasted terrible.
