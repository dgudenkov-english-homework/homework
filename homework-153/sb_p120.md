    I like tasty food and cooking. But I don't like a lot of ingredients. For example, I don't like mayo and all kinds of sausage. I didn't use to like cheese and fish, but lately, I'm starting to like it. I don't like a lot of cold dishes like meat sneaks, jelly meat, some salads, especially with mayo. That's why I like cooking - I exactly know which ingredients I use. I like to try cooking new dishes. During the quarantine, I improved my cooking skills - tried to cook some pies, wok, some unusual dishes. I liked all of them.
