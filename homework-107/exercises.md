What about my special skills? I think it's tennis. I guess, I spent about 2000 hours practicing it. I think bacuse of that I had some success in tennis. I won the first place in my city champioship and won some other medals. I think it all happens because of my grandfather. He trained me a lot and taught me how I should think to win. My dream is to have a teleportation skill. I don't think that I would be successful at this skill if I worked hard on it because it's not a real skill.
