    We are looking for fresh blood for our "Tribewanted" show! We need people who want to live some time like their ancestors! We also want people who are able to survive in the wild and write a blog about it. Your responsibilities on the island will include looking after the gardens, feeding the pigs and chickens, help with the construction of buildings, and writing for the Tribewanted blog. The community is special because of its local traditions. The community will teach you Fijian traditions, songs, etc. By the end of your stay, you will not want to go home.

    Please send your resume to the email 88005553535@tribewanted.com. Interviews will be as soon as you can at our office.
