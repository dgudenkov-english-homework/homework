Past simple:
  This morning I was once again awakened by the ominous sound of a hard, periodic tapping on the glass door downstairs.
Present perfect continuous:
  This has been going on for weeks, every day around 7:00 a.m., which is evidently the hour when the light strikes the window at such an angle that this dumb silly bird sees his own reflection in the glass (and yes I am assuming this bird’s gender — no girl bird would be this aggressive or territorial or dumb) and, identifying it as an enemy bird, attacks it.
Present simple:
  I can’t help but pause at the crossroads to consider the two irrevocable, radically different futures I have to choose between for this last third of my life.
Present continuous:
  I’m still struggling to interpret this omen in any favorable way — this daily wake-up call of a dim-witted creature indefatigably battling itself.
Past perfect:
  It’s a decision I thought I’d already made a long time ago — or, rather, one I never had to make, since it’s one of the few things I’ve always known about myself, one of the givens on which my entire life has been predicated.
Present perfect:
  I have never even briefly second-guessed this decision, which is one reason I’m second-guessing it now
