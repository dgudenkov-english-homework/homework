        - Starbucks has been so successful that now they want to open new stores in China. 
        - The restaurant has had such bad reviews that nobody wants to go there.
        - The food was very bad. I won't go back there again unless they get a new chief.
        - Although, the food was delicious the service was poor.
        - While the restaurant had a good atmosphere, the food was disappointing.

    Wake Up coffee

    This is a small cozy coffee shop near Yandex office in Moscow. The price is a bit expensive - a cup of coffee costs about 200 roubles and about 300 roubles for a coffee with milk like latte or cappuc—Åino. There is a lot of flavours of coffee on the menu. In addition, you'll find some tasty sandwiches and croissants there. Although there are no waiters the barista is very good. They are always smiling and friendly so I like the atmosphere in that coffee shop. Also, the decor in the coffee shop is so cozy. They decorate that place for many holidays like Halloween and Christmas. I strongly recommend this place if you like coffee and a good atmosphere.
