        - Starbucks has been very successful. So they started to open new stores around the world. Now they want to open new stores in China. 
        - The restaurant has had very bad reviews. According to reviews, in the restaurant such awful food and atmosphere. Nobody wants to go there.
        - The food was very bad. I don't go there unless I will be dying from hunger. I will only go back there again if they get a new chief.
        - The food was delicious. Although, you'll probably won't like this restaurant because the service was poor.
        - The restaurant had a good atmosphere, while the food was disappointing.

    Wake Up coffee

    This is a small cozy coffee shop near Yandex office in Moscow. The price is a bit expensive - a cup of coffee costs about 200 roubles and about 300 roubles for coffee with milk like latte or cappuc—Åino. There is a lot of flavours of coffee on the menu. However, you'll find there some tasty sandwiches and croissants. Although there are no waiters the service from the barista is very good. They are always smiling and friendly so I like the atmosphere in that coffee shop. Also, the decor in the coffee shop is so cozy. They decorate that place for many holidays like Halloween and Christmas. I strongly recommend this place if you like coffee and a good atmosphere.
