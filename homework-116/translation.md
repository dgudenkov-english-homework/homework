Daniel is an expert in exact sciences. He is a talented, skillful mathematician and he's gifted in computing. He has had a tendency to math since early childhood, but he has always been hopeless in sport and useless in team sports. He became successful when he was twenty. He was able to multiply big numbers without a calculator at one of the science conferences. Scientists noticed it and gave him the nickname "human-computer". Daniel has been carrying this nickname. Once he told: "I never relied on machines. I believe in the statement, that the possibilities of the human brain are limitless. Although in school I often argued with teachers and children often laughed at me. I chose not the easiest job, but I never complained about it". Also, Daniel managed to learn ten languages in two days and write four books in a week. He has been writing his fifth book since ten o'clock. Now is 3 p.m., that's why he can finish it by evening.
