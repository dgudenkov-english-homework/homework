  Chris Gardener is a successful businessman and a millionaire. But things haven't always been easy. He didn't meet his father until he was twenty-eight years old. This experience made him sure about one thing: he was determined to be a good father to his own children. As a young man, Gardener experienced hard times. His wife left him, he lost his job, and at one stage he and his two-year-old son slept in train stations and airports. He has come a long way since then. His life changed when he met a man driving a red Ferrari and asked him what job he did. The man was a stockbroker, so Gardener asked him out to lunch, and the Ferrari driver introduced Gardener to the world of finance. Since he became successful, he has spent a lot of money helping homeless people, and he has also written books about his experiences. His story was told in the film The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will Smith.
