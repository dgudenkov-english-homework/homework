        - My country changed a lot. It started a new life after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It became more democracy, but now we are going back to dictatorship again.
        - I think the world is getting better for people. But it getting worse for nature.
        - I was born and live all my life in the last thirty years.

    - I love my digital camera. It was more expensive then my last one, but the pictures are much better quality and it's easier to use.
    - But it's much bigger. Isn't it heavier to carry around with you?
    - Actually, it was one of the lightest models in the shop. Although you can get smaller and cheaper cameras, they're not as good as this one.
